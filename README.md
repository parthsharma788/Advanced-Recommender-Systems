# 📌Advanced-Recommender-Systems
## 🔍Overview
This project explores advanced recommender systems using Python. It covers different recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

## 🎯Features

Collaborative Filtering: User-based and item-based filtering techniques.

Content-Based Filtering: Using item features to generate recommendations.

Hybrid Approaches: Combining multiple recommendation strategies for better results.

Evaluation Metrics: Measuring the performance of recommendation models.

## 📊 Data
We will use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.


## 🛠️Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Review

**Memory-based models** are based on similarity between items or users, where we use cosine-similarity.

**Model-based CF** is based on matrix factorization where we use SVD to factorize the matrix.

Building recommender systems that perform well in cold-start scenarios (where little data is available on new users and items) remains a challenge. The standard collaborative filtering method performs poorly is such settings.
